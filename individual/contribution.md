I contributed most to the analytical workflow by cleaning the data, exploring key churn drivers, and helping shape the modeling approach. I helped dive deep into XBoost modeling and creating SHAP plots. In addition, I also supported the team by structuring the insights into a clear, precise and executive-ready narrative.

I advocated for focusing on interpretability rather than only model accuracy. In a business setting, stakeholders need to understand why customers churn, not just which customers are at risk. This helped us choose models and visualizations that were easier to explain and defend.

Personally, I learned the importance of aligning technical work with business impact and communicating insights in a simple, compelling way. With more time, I would focus more on feature engineering and test additional modeling techniques to see if we could boost performance without sacrificing interpretability.
